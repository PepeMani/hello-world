Politeness is cool sometimes, y'know ?

even if it's secondary, not necessary or even time-wasting (sometimes) when solutions are needed..

Sociability still goes on without politeness if it's replaced by being frank and honest,
and so rest what you feel about it (honesty and "truth") and your ability to deal with it. To deal with facts.

Learning to do so is learning to go quicker while maintaining work and action, to keep on going while assimilating and organizing the facts,
and to see an end to every projects no matter how shitty it started (if unpoliteness is well-reglemented).

So shut up, go quicker and then you can try and beat the fuck out of me, so we can finally take our coffee.
